# Chaos-Cubes-Art
Computer graphics artwork. It's raster graphics which simulates Brownian motion.

# How to use
Open chaos_cubes.py file, download required modules and run the script. The resulting file will be saved with the name cubes.gif. There is demo file named demo which demonstrate artwork.

# More about work
This work simulates Brownian motion. Faces of cubes drawn with Bresenham's algorithm. Then two cubes collide they change they rotation and moving vector.
